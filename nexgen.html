							<h2>NexGen Case Study</h2>
							<h3>About OpenSignal</h3>
							<p>OpenSignal is the number one worldwide provider of mobile coverage and performance info. Their data is crowdsourced by users of their main two apps OpenSignal and Meteor. The data is crowdsourced by users of the OpenSignal app, downloaded over 20 million times, which constantly monitors the coverage and performance of their mobile connection. OpenSignal uses this data to increase transparency in the wireless industry by publishing reports on the quality of mobile networks, offering unbiased coverage maps and empowering people to get better mobile connectivity in a hassle-free way.</p>
              <h3>The Brief</h3>
							<p>The client needed a brand new app that related speed tests with video streaming performance.
              I joined the project during its early stages, however I did not take part in the user research that took place before the first mockups were created. One of the first tasks assigned to me was to create wireframes and lo-fi mockups of the app and user flows that reflected the process.</p>
              <div class="flow">
              	<img src="./images/flow1.png" alt="User Flow">

							</div>
							<p class="italic"><br>First mid fidelity mockups.</p>
							<h3>Challenges</h3>
							<p>The very first challenged I encounter was based on the fact that the app relied on a very technical process of testing video performance based on a network’s speed. Were tests going to be done on a single video or a platform as a whole? If a whole platform was going to be tested what video would be shown during the test? Would several platforms be tested one after the other or would the user be able to choose what platform to test? How long would the test take and how did that relate to the video shown? All of these concepts would greatly affect the app’s design.</p>
							<h3>The Solution</h3>
							<p>We decided to move forward with the idea that tests would be done for a single platform at a time and users would choose what platform to choose at the beginning. The lead UX designer, Malgo and I created mid fidelity mockups and did a brainstorm to come up with ways in which we would show the results for the tests. Once we had the basic structure for the app we began the prototyping stage in which we created a fully high fidelity, functional version of the video test functionality.</p>
							<h3>User Testing</h3>
							<p>We began doing user testing both internally and externally quite early in the development process. Internal testing was conducted by myself in order to get early feedback on the very first prototype we created. External testing was done over Skype sessions, some of which I conducted myself and some of which I took notes of the feedback given by the testers. These tests provided valuable information and shone light on several issues in the design.</p>
							<h3>Process</h3>
							<p>The process consisted of hi-fi prototypes, user testing feedback and several iterations. Early prototypes had a very playful look and showed video events during the test in the form of floating bubbles. After testing, we noticed that the bubbles created confusion and overwhelmed users during the test. A feeling which stayed with users and prevented them from understanding the results. Later prototypes consisted of a more polished look, while still remaining friendly and playful. In addition, we redesigned the way events were showed in order to make them accessible and less confusing. User testing of this prototype showed that people reacted better to this simplified approach to video events. Although some confusion still remained, the overall experience was a lot more accessible and by the second test performed most users had a good understanding of how the test worked.</p>
